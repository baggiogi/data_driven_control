- The folder `synthetic` contains the Matlab functions and scripts for computing optimal data-driven controls and for comparing the performance of model-based and data-driven controls in synthetic experimental settings.

- The folder `fMRI` contains the code for computing optimal data-driven controls from task-based fMRI data.

- The folder `power grid` contains the code for computing optimal data-driven controls for fault recovery in power grid networks.

- The folder `kuramoto` contains the code for computing optimal data-driven controls for pattern synchronization in a ring of Kuramoto oscillators.
